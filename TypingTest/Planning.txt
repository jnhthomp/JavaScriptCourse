GOAL:
Create a webpage that allows a user to see a list of words. The object is type each word as quickly as possible for 1 minute. When the minute is the words per minute (wpm) typed are displayed

Outline:
  UI
    Must show list of words
      Create HTML word box
        approximately 40 characters across
        2 rows
      Highlight current word
      When end of row reach scroll down so the second row is on top
      Insert new row below to maintain 2 rows
    Have user input box to type in
    After completing a word (space is pressed) clear text box
    Display calculated WPM
    Have reset button
    Show countdown timer

  CalculateWPM
    [(All typed entries / 5) - Uncorrected Errors] / Time(min)




Future features:
Adjust amount of time allowed for test



scratch

In typing area:
When any key is pressed{
start countdown timer
}
This happens when spacebar is pressed
if(whatUserEnters == firstWord){// firstWord = word before space
 count number of letters of that word
 add to the score
 remove firstWord from wordList
 clear user input field
} else {
  compare the string the user entered to the word
  See how many characters are different.
  add number of letters to allTypedEntries
  Add incorrect entries to uncorrectedErrors
  remove firstWord from wordList
  clear user input field
}


When space is pressed we want to
Look at what user typed
Look at what they were supposed to type
For each letter in the testWord string
  compare to the letter in the same place in the typedWord sting
Clear userInput from field
Delete the first word from wordList
Add the length of testWord to a running total
  If 2 characters don't match
    Add 1 to uncorrectedErrors variables
Return the length of the testWord and the number of uncorrectedErrors
Add the length of testWord and uncorrectedErrors to running total
Once time is up
  Send the totals to budgetController.CalculateWPM();
  Return the WPM to global controller
Send WPM to UIController to display

in typingArea eventListener
If(keypressed == spacebar){
  var typedWord = domStrings.typingArea.value;
  var wordEnd = wordList.indexOf(' ', 0)
  var testWord = wordList.slice(0,wordEnd);

  var uncorrectedErrors = 0;
  var i = 0;
  while(i < testWord.length){
    var curTyped = typedWord.charAt(i);
    var curTest = testWord.charAt(i);
    if(curTyped !== curTest){
      uncorrectedErrors++;
    }
    i++;
  }
  clear domStrings.typingArea //See budgety recap
  delete wordList[0]; //Everything
  return {
    typedEntries: testWord.length,
    errors: uncorrectedErrors};
}

finding testWord:
  find index of ' '
    wordEnd = wordList.indexOf(' ', 0) // 0 not necessary sets start
  set everything up to that point as the testWord
    testWord = wordList.slice(0, wordEnd);
