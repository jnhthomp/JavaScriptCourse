Fake Bank TODO:

	Create HTML outline
		Steal from Chase for now?
		can later edit and change to make a little more unique/generic/not as obvious it's a copy

	Allow login using non-specific credentials
		if username contains x then username is valid
		if password contains x then password is valid
		All valid logins show the same information
		Have private function for handling logins if(loginValid == true)

	Add fake transactions (google play, itunes, walmart, best buy, etc.)

	Block page with clear empty div
		Allow div to be disabled with an inconspicuous button click

	Adjust/add automatic timeout
	
Future TODO:

	Randomize Bank name (array option below. Maybe do object instead?)
		give all instances of titles and logos a specific class
			class = bankName
			class = bankLogo
		available options are stored in an array bankName[name0, name1, name2]
		Gen random number
			randNum = Math.random();
			randNum = Math.floor(randNum * bankName.length);
		displayBankName = bankName[randNum]
		use displayBankName as content for all instances of classBankName
		have a logo option that matches the color scheme below (potentially bank name as well?)
			Try using a vector and inserting color options from below into CSS sheet
	
	Randomize color templates
		similar as above but with multiple colors (array inside array? object?)

	Create a js command template for adding a new recent transaction
		Add option to cancel/delete/reject transaction/incoming payment for specified time period
			15 minutes? 24 hours?
	
	Add "POTENTIAL SCAM DETECTED" pop-up
		Activated by:
			adding new transaction with JS command template from above
			manually after they have edited HTML w/ hotkey/hidden button
