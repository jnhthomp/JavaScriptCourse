Create HTML outline

		This template: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_architect.htm
			HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_architect&stacked=h

Edit all HTML/CSS tags to not be w3 (too obvious on inspect element)

	Only changed ones that were used in CSS so I can organize them together and store the extra unused options for later
