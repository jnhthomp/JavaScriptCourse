Goal:
  Create a playable version of Minesweeper
  Use Figma to design
What is needed:

UI:
  A field of clickable buttons(9x9) (10x10)(Generate HTML (please.))
    Each button needs a unique id with column&row #
      Ex: c01r0, c0r1, c0r2 etc.
    Bombs that are assigned to each button (bomb locations array?)
      Locations should be randomly generated
      Bombs to button ratio (~1:9)
    Player should be able to place flags
      Right click adds and removes flags
      Number of flags is limited to number of bombs
      Flagged squares can't be activated

  A number displaying bombs remaining

  A timer counting up

  A display showing when the user wins

  A reset button to clear all bombs and reset mine buttons

Data:
  Creates bomb locations
  Stores bomb locations
  Stores flag locations
  Removes flag locations
  Calculate number of bombs touching a button after clicked

Main:
  Passes communications between UI and Data


Process:
  Page Load:
    Page will load with 9x9 field of buttons
    There will be a number displayed representing amount of flags
    There will be a timer (starting at 0) that starts when the user clicks (later)

  User leftClick
    First click
      Generate array of bomb locations(clicked button is invalid)
      Go to every square touching the clicked square and read each ID
        (make an array of touching squares?)
        DO NOT INCLUDE FLAGGED SQUARES
        Count number of matching ID's listed in bombLocations array
        Display that number on the activated square
        If no bombs are touching then activate all touching squares as well
          Repeat above for all touching squares
    2nd+ clicks
      Go to every square touching the clicked square ad read each ID
        (make an array of touching squares?)
        DO NOT INCLUDE FLAGGED SQUARES
        Count number of matching ID's listed in bombLocations array
        Display that number on the activated square
        If no bombs are touching then activate all touching squares as well
          Repeat above for all touching squares

    Clicks square with number
      If number displayed <= number of flags touching
        Activate all touching squares that do not have flags
      If number displayed > number of flags touching
        Do nothing

  User rightClick
    If no flag on button (is not in flag array)
      Place a flag
        Add to array of flag locations
        Subtract 1 from bombCount
        Ignore this square when checking for touching bombs and activating

    If flag on button (is in flag array)
      Remove flag
        Remove from array of flag locations
        Add 1 to bombCount
        Activate this square when checking for touching bombs and activating



SCRATCH:

Main board UI and data ID's are generated

Generate bomb locations
  Go through idArray and select 10 random items
  Each time 1 is selected make sure it cannot be reselected
    Either remove it from the list or check to see if it already exists as a bomb location and if so run it again without adding or increasing counter
  Save array to game.bombIDs;


Generate grid objects
  Create a new object for each button on the grid
    Should contain:
      ID
      Column Number
      Row Number
      A function to calculate which other buttons it's touching
      An array to store touching buttons
      A function to calculate if/how many of the touching buttons have bombs
      An array to store which touching buttons have bombs
      A boolean for whether or not it has a flag
      A boolean for whether or not it has a bomb

Create event listener for .gameContainer (field)
  Identify what kind of click it was (single/double)
    On single click run flag function
    On double click run activate function
  Flag function
    Add flag icon to button
    Mark it as a flag in the flag array
    Disable double click on this button
  Activate function
    Change background color to slightly darker
